# Sales classification Model for real-time sales data 

## Problem Statement Summary:
Predict E-commerce visitor conversion using the provided dataset's "has_converted" target variable. Conduct thorough data exploration, build three classification models, and assess their performance on live stream data, displaying precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score for each model.

## Solution Approach:
### Data cleaning and feature engineering 
The data was cleaned and the features were carefully engineered to avoid the curse of dimensionality whilst maintaining precession 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Utilize data visualization and statistical analysis to understand patterns, relationships, and insights within the dataset, showcasing results in a Streamlit app.

### Model Building: 
Implement at least three classification models after preprocessing and feature selection, and evaluate their performance metrics (precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score) using the provided target variable.

### Live Stream Predictions:
Apply the trained models to predict customer conversion on live stream data, providing real-time insights for decision-making. Display the performance metrics of the three models for comprehensive evaluation.

### Precision and accuracy 
The model is tested with precision and accuracy and f1 score to ensure best performance and accurate results
